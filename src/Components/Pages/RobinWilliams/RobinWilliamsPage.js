            "To properly understand an individual's discourse it is necessary to critically understand their position
            within the social hierarchy because language is a social practice through which the world is reified and can
            be used to exercise power, domination, resistance, and subordination (Fairclough, 1989, Van Dijk, 2006).

            from a Korean grocer to a Hollywood agent and a juror. The New York Times has called Smith “the ultimate
            impressionist – she does people’s souls.” The film is an account of how Korean, African American, & Mexican
            families were impacted during the 'riots', as well as how systemic racism has developed or became
            deep-rooted into our societies and police forces. Smith through all the families and interviewees calls out
            and advises against ignorance, hate, and violence. They call against the oppression, discrimination, and

            comedian's extraordinary life and career, revealing what drove him to give voice to the incredible
            characters he created in his mind.
            <br />
            <br />
            Told largely through Williams' own voice, captured in interviews and audio recordings, and with a wealth of
            never-before-seen footage, including home movies and film/TV outtakes, the film showcases Williams'
            boundless energy, lightning wit and knack for creating memorable characters on stage and screen. The
            documentary also features personal archival material and new interviews with those who loved and knew
            Williams best, including Billy Crystal, Pam Dawber, David Letterman, Steve Martin and many more. Directed by
            Marina Zenovich, Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind delves into the intricacies of a man who needed an
            audience just as much as audiences needed someone like him

            An interesting/meaningful part that you could say more about is at the end of that section, where you describe feeling nauseous about the "systemic issues."
            
            Focus here on saying more about what those issues are, specifically, and what the "inevitable future" might look like 
            (briefly describe the issues so the reader can empathize and connect to your point; again, we all feel nauseous about them).
            
            Then, add a sentence connecting that part to Robin Williams 
            (what he offered us as a kind of antidote to all the above, and how it feels to have to fill in the space ourselves without him).

            I was quite depressed while watching the documentaries covering Robin Williams Life, as he is not only an
            idol to myself but several others as well. Although he left us far too soon, his work, aspirations, and
            legacy will live on to inspire new generations.
            <br />
            <br />I chose to watch them, as I get very nauseous and I feel severely sick to my stomach thinking about
            the systemic issues we face today and the inevitable future we are headed towards.

              "Although not directly related to the political scene in Collin County, we, along with millions of other
              Americans, mourn the loss today, of Hollywood actor Robin Williams. As we take a moment to reflect back on
              the laughter and the joy he gave to so many of us... We are thankful for the smiles he generated across
              party lines. We are also thankful for the many serious roles he portrayed, which opened our eyes to the
              many collective problems and issues within our society.

            <p>
              'Robin Williams was an airman, a doctor, a genie, a nanny, a president, a professor, a bangarang Peter
              Pan, and everything in between. But he was one of a kind. He arrived in our lives as an alien — but he
              ended up touching every element of the human spirit. He made us laugh. He made us cry. He gave his
              immeasurable talent freely and generously to those who needed it most — from our troops stationed abroad
              to the marginalized on our own streets.' As we think back on Mr. Williams, and his storied career, let us
              also think ahead – – and make an honest effort, to show a little more kindness and gentility, compassion
              and social justice to those who need it most

            According to Robin Williams’ widow, an autopsy has revealed that the comedian suffered from Lewy body
            dementia before he committed suicide. Susan Schneider Williams described the battle to treat and understand
            her late husband's symptoms as a game of Whac-A-Mole. William Brangham learns about the lesser-known but
            common illness from Dr. James Galvin of Florida Atlantic University.
