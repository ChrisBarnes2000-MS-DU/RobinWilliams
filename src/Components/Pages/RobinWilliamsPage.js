          <h4>Why I chose them and how they made me feel.</h4>

          <p>
            I was quite depressed while watching the documentaries covering Robin Williams Life, as he is not only an
            idol to myself but several others as well. Although he left us far too soon, his work, aspirations, and
            legacy will live on to inspire new generations.
            <br />
            <br />I chose to watch them, in hopes to avoid or work around the topics being assigned/portrayed for this
            polymodal project as I get very nauseous and I feel severely sick to my stomach thinking about the systemic
            issues we face today and the inevitable future we are headed towards.

            I watched Robin Williams Remembered: A love letter to a unique and irrepressible comic talent, who left us
            far too soon, & Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind, which takes it's viewers through the one-of-a-kind
            actor and comedian's extraordinary life and career, revealing what drove him to give voice to the incredible
            characters he created in his mind.
            <br />
            <br />
            Told largely through Williams' own voice, captured in interviews and audio recordings, and with a wealth of
            never-before-seen footage, including home movies and film/TV outtakes, the film showcases Williams'
            boundless energy, lightning wit and knack for creating memorable characters on stage and screen. The
            documentary also features personal archival material and new interviews with those who loved and knew
            Williams best, including Billy Crystal, Pam Dawber, David Letterman, Steve Martin and many more. Directed by
            Marina Zenovich, Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind delves into the intricacies of a man who needed an
            audience just as much as audiences needed someone like him.

            Although not directly related to the political scene in Collin County, we, along with millions of other
            Americans, mourn the loss today, of Hollywood actor Robin Williams. As we take a moment to reflect back on
            the laughter and the joy he gave to so many of us... We are thankful for the smiles he generated across
            party lines. We are also thankful for the many serious roles he portrayed, which opened our eyes to the many
            collective problems and issues within our society.

          <h5>WHITE HOUSE STATEMENT FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA. August 11, 2014.</h5>
          <p>
            “Robin Williams was an airman, a doctor, a genie, a nanny, a president, a professor, a bangarang Peter Pan,
            and everything in between. But he was one of a kind. He arrived in our lives as an alien — but he ended up
            touching every element of the human spirit. He made us laugh. He made us cry. He gave his immeasurable
            talent freely and generously to those who needed it most — from our troops stationed abroad to the
            marginalized on our own streets.” As we think back on Mr. Williams, and his storied career, let us also
            think ahead – – and make an honest effort, to show a little more kindness and gentility, compassion and
            social justice to those who need it most.
