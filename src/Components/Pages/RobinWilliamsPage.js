              <h1>Dear Mr. Williams</h1>
              <p>Although you are unable to get this, I felt I should write to you anyway.</p>
              <p>
                I was quite depressed while watching the documentaries covering your Life, as you are not only an idol
                to myself but several others as well. I chose to rewatch them, as I get very nauseous and I feel
                severely sick to my stomach thinking about the systemic issues we face today and the inevitable future
                we are headed towards.

                Although not directly related to the political scene in Collin County, we, along with millions of other
                Americans, mourn the loss today, of Hollywood actor Robin Williams. As we take a moment to reflect back
                on the laughter and the joy he gave to so many of us... we are thankful for the smiles he generated
                across party lines. We are also thankful for the many serious roles he portrayed, which opened our eyes
                to the many collective problems and issues within our society.

                <strong>WHITE HOUSE STATEMENT FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA. August 11, 2014.</strong>
                <br />
                “Robin Williams was an airman, a doctor, a genie, a nanny, a president, a professor, a bangarang Peter
                Pan, and everything in between. But he was one of a kind. He arrived in our lives as an alien — but he
                ended up touching every element of the human spirit. He made us laugh. He made us cry. He gave his
                immeasurable talent freely and generously to those who needed it most — from our troops stationed abroad
                to the marginalized on our own streets. As we think back on Mr. Williams, and his storied career, let us
                also think ahead – and make an honest effort, to show a little more kindness and gentility, compassion
                and social justice to those who need it most -(Robin Williams And The Stigma Of Mental Illness)."

                It’s tragic and upsetting the way media or local news portrays that it takes murder, death, loss, pain,
                suffering, or hate to get things done. In spite of the recent 2020 COVID Pandemic, the social and racial
                protests/riots, and general systemic issues we face today, your work remains to inspire generation after
                generation. Though not all the credit you get is solely yours, the teams you worked for and with,
                believe you: as their leader, idol, friend, and to have been the one to deserve and hold the honor of
                said credit.

                Twilight Los Angeles, a one-woman play; Smith gives voice to 40 real-life “characters,” from a Korean
                grocer to a Hollywood agent and a juror. The New York Times has called Smith “the ultimate impressionist
                – she does people’s souls.” The film is an account of how Korean, African American, & Mexican families
                were impacted during the 'riots', as well as how systemic racism has developed or became deep-rooted
                into our societies and police forces. Smith through all the families and interviewees calls out and
                advises against ignorance, hate, and violence. They call against the oppression, discrimination, and
                belittlement of the minorities and new arrivals -(Twilight: Los Angeles | About The Production)."

                Jumping from person to person without explaining the entire situation in great detail. It lacks a
                cohesive storytelling element and presents NO facts, statistics, or possible solutions that could have
                resolved things before, during, and after the situation. It lacks a reasonable explanation of what
                happened and attempts to make the viewer feel pity, disgust, anger, or depression as they are some of
                the easier pathos to provoke. Rather than finding a peaceful solution, it presents the violence that
                happened in the streets.

                Whereas, Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind by Marina Zenovich, features personal archival material and
                new interviews with those who loved and knew Williams best, including Billy Crystal, Pam Dawber, David
                Letterman, Steve Martin, and many more. Told largely through Williams' own voice, captured in interviews
                and audio recordings, and with a wealth of never-before-seen footage, including home movies and film/TV
                outtakes, the film showcases Williams' boundless energy, lightning wit and knack for creating memorable
                characters on stage and screen. The documentary delves into the intricacies of a man who needed an
                audience just as much as audiences needed someone like him -(Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind)."
                Before Continue, We Must Discuss: What Is Social Justice? Social justice is the assertion of the ideal
                that all humans should have the same rights and opportunities. From access to healthcare to safe spaces
                to live, social justice aims to level the playing field and eliminate discrimination. The idea behind
                social justice is that we all have innate value as human beings, and no person’s value is more or less
                than anyone else’s. The modern concept of social justice has roots in the 19th century, coinciding with
                greater social mobility and a growing middle class. The women’s suffrage movement in the late 19th and
                early 20th centuries and the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s are two examples. Facilitated
                by today’s hyperconnectivity, social justice movements large and small have found their way into the
                mainstream consciousness -(What Are Social Justice Issues).”

                Twilight may be worse because of the strong emotions it inflicts and the visceral portrayal of violence
                and rioting along with the lack of solution or planning towards change. Humans are innately lazy and
                without clear instructions, call to arms, and support, the drive to organize or make change won’t be
                facilitated. The Twilight documentary does not give you a good impression of what was actually happening
                before, during, or after the time of the riots. It really only tries to enhance the emotional impact of
                the situation without bringing in any actually logical solutions or present ways that could have been
                used to protest without violence. There were a few scenes of Smith's performance where I noticed the
                changes in the way Smith relaxed her face, based on the person she was playing. She would set her face
                up like an asian woman when she was playing one! I could definitely see it. I feel the purpose of a
                "one-person-play" is to communicate the ideas, and not focus on the person expressing them.
                <br />
                In contrast to this, Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind isn’t much better due to their softened tone
                towards our impacts on others around us and the subjects of mental health. The Robin Williams
                documentary takes viewers through the one-of-a-kind actor and comedian's extraordinary life and career,
                revealing what drove him to give voice to the incredible characters he created in his mind. According to
                Robin Williams’ widow, an autopsy has revealed that the comedian suffered from Lewy body dementia before
                he committed suicide. Susan Schneider, Williams described the battle to treat and understand her late
                husband's symptoms as a game of Whac-A-Mole.

              <h2>The Universal Issues With Interpretations vs Intentions</h2>
              <p className="quote">
                I agree with Robertson, Ray in "Can We All Get Along?” he claims "To properly understand an individual's
                discourse it is necessary to critically understand their position within the social hierarchy because
                language is a social practice through which the world is reified and can be used to exercise power,
                domination, resistance, and subordination (Fairclough, 1989, Van Dijk, 2006)."
              </p>
              <p>
                To give a quick example of this, in relation to Robin Williams and several other famous people, they are
                attributed phases, quotes, parts of films, moments in history, etc, etc… but over time and without
                proper moderation and accreditation, misinformation is prone to happen due to an effect similar to the
                internationally popular children's game: Chinese whispers or telephone. Where players form a line or
                circle, and the first player comes up with a message and whispers it to the ear of the second person in
                the line. The second player repeats the message to the third player, and so on… After reaching the final
                player they either then tell the first player or they just say the final version of the message aloud. I
                say “Final Message” because due to miscommunication and misunderstanding, the message gets alerted and
                tends to be quite distinct from the original message.
              </p>
              <p className="quote">
                Another quick example of miscommunication being American Sign Language, and Military Sign Language.
                Covered more in depth here and here, Kim “argued that many of these problems were “common sense” and
                didn’t require the intervention of cultural experts to intervene. In a comment on that post Carl Dyke
                wrote:
                <p className="quote">
                  I’m inclined to agree with you, Kerim, but when you talk about common sense in an anthropological
                  setting I get confused. Common to whom, under what circumstances, according to which rituals,
                  restrictions and agendas? I teach soldiers who have been or soon will be deployed. Like all of my
                  students some of them tumble quickly to the value of taking the perspective of the other, while some
                  are more rule or authority oriented. They seem to have different ‘common senses’ depending on how and
                  where they were raised, where they are in their emotional-cognitive development, their sense of
                  identity and purpose, their levels of stress, and so on. Conflictual situations are notoriously poor
                  ones for optimizing reciprocity of communication, as the post on the myth of Mars and Venus also
                  shows. Short of a desirable but currently unlikely elimination of all conflict, what sorts of
                  practical steps would in your view improve understanding under these difficult circumstances? Is there
                  a specific way of understanding ‘common sense’ that gets us further there? -("How (Not) To Signal
                  “Stop” | Savage Minds")
                </p>
              </p>
              <p>
                Similar to Carl Dyke, I have noticed “common sense” has never and may never truly be common at least
                until we are united globally rather than state or continental or ethnically. But even then we are still
                prone to Interpretation vs Intention issues when communicating.

              <h2>To Conclude</h2>
              <h4>I will leave off with these quotes from Rodney King:</h4>
              <p className="text-center">
                “As far as having peace within myself, the one way I can do that is forgiving the people who have done
                wrong to me. 
                <br />
                It causes more stress to build up anger. Peace is more productive.”
