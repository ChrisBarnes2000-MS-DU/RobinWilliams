Social justice is the assertion of the ideal that all humans should have the same rights and opportunities. From access to healthcare to safe spaces to live, social justice aims to level the playing field and eliminate discrimination. The idea behind social justice is that we all have innate value as human beings, and no person\u2019s value is more or less than anyone else\u2019s. The modern concept of social justice has roots in the 19th century, coinciding with greater social mobility and a growing middle class. The women\u2019s suffrage movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s are two examples.
